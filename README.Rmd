**leafpeepr** prepares data for weighting with raking packages like [**autumn**](https://github.com/aaronrudkin/autumn).
It creates weighting targets from census microdata.
It can also recode values and collapse values into an *other* category in both census data and survey data. 

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rossellhayes/leafpeepr")
```

## Usage

Let's get an example dataset of census microdata ready to be used as targets for raking.

```{r}
library(leafpeepr)
acs_nh
```

### Recoding

`leaf_recode()` recodes columns using a data frame as a map.

```{r}
acs_sex_codes

leaf_recode(acs_nh, acs_sex_codes)
```

The recoding map can also use formulas.

```{r}
acs_bpl_codes

leaf_recode(acs_nh, acs_bpl_codes)
```

Or a combination of values and formulas.

```{r}
acs_educ_codes

leaf_recode(acs_nh, acs_educ_codes)
```

You can recode multiple columns at once using wide or long data frames.

```{r}
acs_codes
leaf_recode(acs_nh, acs_codes)

acs_codes_long
leaf_recode(acs_nh, acs_codes_long)
```

### Creating interaction variables

`leaf_interact()` creates an interaction between two variables.

```{r}
acs_nh_recoded <- leaf_recode(acs_nh, acs_codes) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() #Make column names nicer to look at

leaf_interact(acs_nh_recoded, race, hispan)
```

`leaf_interactions()` creates multiple interactions at once using a list.

```{r}
leaf_interactions(acs_nh_recoded, c("race", "educ"), c("sex", "age"))
```

`leaf_interact_all()` creates interactions between one variable and all other variables.

```{r}
leaf_interact_all(acs_nh_recoded, sex, except = perwt)
```


### Generating a target data frame

Once our data is recoded, `leaf_peep()` prepares it to be used as weighting targets in `autumn::harvest()`

```{r}
acs_nh_interacted <- leaf_interactions(
  acs_nh_recoded, c("race", "educ"), c("sex", "age")
)

leaf_peep(acs_nh_interacted, weight_col = perwt)
```

### Collapsing categories

```{r, include = FALSE}
options(tibble.print_min = 10, tibble.print_max = 10)
```

`leaf_other()` recategorizes levels into an other category if their proportion is below a certain cutoff.

```{r}
acs_nh_targets <- leaf_peep(acs_nh_interacted, weight_col = perwt)

dplyr::arrange(acs_nh_targets, proportion)

leaf_other(acs_nh_targets, 0.01) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(proportion)
```

If the other category would itself be under the cutoff proportion, the next smallest level is added to the other category.
To avoid this, set `inclusive = FALSE`.

```{r}
leaf_other(acs_nh_targets, 0.01, inclusive = FALSE) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(proportion)
```
